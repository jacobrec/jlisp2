* JLisp2
  The sequel to the classic

** Self hosting
   JLisp2 is an interpreter, but it's one that's self hosting. While
   the inital implementation was written in Ruby, all of the read and
   eval functionality was rewritten in jlisp itself

** Speed
   JLisp2 is functional self interpreter, however, the lisp
   interpreter running on a ruby interpreter is really slow. No
   benchmarks are provided, you'll have to trust me on that.

** Features
   Macros, Reader Macros, Closures, and Lists. Everything you could want in a
   lisp. It also features hashmaps as a builtin datatype. For
   convince, functions support optional, and rest arguments.

** Minimal language
   The language has minimal special forms, =if=, =def=, =set=, =let=,
   =quasiquote=, =quote=, =fn=, and, =macro=. Everything else is just
   a function.
